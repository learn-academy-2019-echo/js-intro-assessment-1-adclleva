## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: 
  
  The console.log() function prints the value within the parentheses and returns an undefined.
  
  While return gives back the value after the return keyterm and immediately exits out of a function.

  Researched answer:
  
  The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value.
  
  The console.log(); is a function (you can see the brackets) that will write the argument value on the console. 
  And only the debuging console, in a browser you will not see anything on the screen.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: 
  
  An argument is what you put inside the parentheses of a function when you are declaring a function.
  
  Variables are the names of the specific value that you declare them as. You can place variables within the parentheses of a 
  function once it is declared.

  Researched answer:

  A parameter is a variable in a method definition. 
  When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer:
  
  Role of the Navigator - is the one guided the one on the keyboard to make sure they are going in the right direction to their solution.
  Role of the Driver - is the one typing on the keyboard and typing towards the solution while communicating to the Navigator what their thoughts are
  
  Proper pair programming techniques include those that involve concise and respectful communication for both the Driver and Navigator.

  Researched answer:
  
  “Pair programmers: 
   Keep each other on task. Brainstorm refinements to the system. Clarify ideas. 
   Take initiative when their partner is stuck, thus lowering frustration. 
   Hold each other accountable to the team’s practices. 
   Pairing” 
            - Kent Beck
  
  "Strong-style pairing is the approach in which the driver does nothing that the reviewer did not direct them to. 
   As explained by Llewellyn, “For an idea to go from your head to the computer it must go through someone else’s hands.”
